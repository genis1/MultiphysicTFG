This projects works on an Euclidean 3D space (Eculidean3DSpace.java)

All objects have relations to its constituents. All constituents of dimension n > 0 have relation to its composites of dimension n + 1.
This relations are created in the constructor of the composite and removed by Euclidean3DSpace.java
